"""
The password on the door.

The customer asked for one password on the whole platform, and this module is
all of it: a login endpoint that turns the password into a bearer token, a
verifier, and the ASGI middleware that refuses every other request until that
token is presented.

What it is NOT. This is a shared demo password, not identity. Knowing it says
you are allowed into the demo, not who you are, so nothing downstream reads
anything from the token: row-level security still resolves from the persona
and identity exactly as it did before (`api/main.py`), and a token cannot
widen a scope. When the product moves behind Entra, this middleware is what
gets replaced and the endpoints behind it do not change.

The token is bearer-only. There is no cookie, so the browser never sends it
on its own and there is nothing for a cross-site page to ride on; the client
attaches it to each request explicitly. Its shape is
`urlsafe-base64("<expiry>.<signature>")`, where the signature is an HMAC over
the expiry under a secret derived from the password. That makes a token
self-describing — no session table, nothing to survive a restart — and it
means every outstanding token is void the moment the password is rotated
through `NTT_ACCESS_PASSWORD`, which is exactly what a rotation is for.

Two development switches turn the gate off: `NTT_ACCESS_DISABLED=1` in the
environment, or the presence of `.access-disabled` beside `api/`. The file is
gitignored and checked on every request, so it cannot ship and it takes
effect the instant it appears or disappears — no restart, no reload.
