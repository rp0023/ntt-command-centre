"""
A keyword planner for free text, used only when no language model can plan.

The model-driven path turns a question into a small query plan — metric,
subset, breakdown, time grain — and the server executes that plan. When every
provider is rate-limited the plan still has to come from somewhere, and for
the shapes of question this product actually gets ("open pipeline by rep",
"win rate by industry", "closed-won by month") a handful of word rules produce
the same plan the model would.

It is deliberately narrow. It returns None whenever it cannot name at least one
of a metric, a subset or a breakdown from the words in the question, and the
caller turns that into a calm refusal with two questions that are known to
work. Guessing a plan for "why did Cobalt slip" and drawing a bar chart of
gross profit would be worse than saying the question is not one the data can
answer as asked.

The plan it emits goes through the same `query.validate` as a model's, so a
word that happens to match a dimension label cannot widen the caller's scope
or name a column outside the registry.
