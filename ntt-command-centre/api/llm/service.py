"""
The six AI surfaces, each with an explicit job and an explicit prohibition.

The governing rule, from the user's own brief: *the AI features must be unique
and must not feel redundant with the charts; we shall not share the same info
again and again.* So every surface here is defined by what it says that the
charts on the same screen CANNOT, and the server enforces that mechanically via
`grounding.strip_redundant` rather than trusting a sentence in a prompt.

  brief        the situation in four sentences — mechanism and decision, not levels
  explain      why one card fired, from the recorded history behind it
  ask          free text in; a validated query plan, a chart, and a narration out
  nextAction   the specific next move on one deal, written to the rep
  digest       what changed in the movement log since a given date
  modelRead    how much to trust the closure model, in plain words

Every surface degrades to a computed template rather than to an error. If every
provider is down the page still reads as a finished product, and the response
says `degraded: true` so nobody mistakes a template for a model.
