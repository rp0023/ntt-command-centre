"""
The regression harness. `./run.sh verify`.

Three things are asserted here and nowhere else:

1. **The figures.** Every headline number the demo will say out loud is pinned.
   If a refactor moves one, this fails rather than the customer noticing.
2. **The three use cases** the client asked for on the 16 Sep call — anomaly
   detection, deal-closure likelihood with red/green feature benchmarking, and
   cross-sell/upsell identification — are each checked end to end, from the
   source file through to a rendered payload.
3. **The guarantees**, rather than just the values: that row-level security
   actually narrows, that a persona cannot reach another persona's page, that
   every chart declares a claim key, that the AI cannot restate a chart, and
   that nothing in the product silently computes a margin as an average.

Exit code is the number of failures, so CI can gate on it.
