"""
Anomaly intelligence: the data-science team's findings, enriched, triaged and
routed — plus the subset this layer recomputes itself from the movement log.

Two provenances live side by side here, and the distinction is shown on screen
rather than blurred:

  `ds-model`  the 485 findings in Client_Anomaly_Report.csv, produced by the
              data-science team's own detectors (rule, adaptive-threshold and a
              multivariate ML pass). Replayed, not recomputed — several of them
              (the ML outlier, the peer-IQR fences) are the DS team's model and
              re-deriving them here would be inventing a second answer to a
              question they already own.
  `live`      types this layer derives directly from the 36,631-row change log
              at request time. These exist so the capability is demonstrably
              live rather than a CSV being read back, and so the platform keeps
              working the moment the movement data changes.

Where both fire on the same opportunity they are reconciled rather than listed
twice, and the card says both agreed — which is the strongest form the finding
can take.

The card contract is the client's own, from the 15 Sep call: *what* it is, *why*
it fired (evidence), *how severe*, *what value* is at stake, *who* owns it, and
the *recommended action*.

    Row-level security for findings, grain by grain.

    `for_persona` answers which findings a ROLE is the right person to act on.
    This answers which of those THIS caller may see, and the two are different
    questions: an account-concentration finding is routed to every AE, but an
    AE has no business reading one about an account they hold no line at, and
    a manager coaching a rep in another pod is coaching someone else's team.
    Before this existed the narrowing stopped at opportunity grain, so a rep
    with 44 findings of their own was shown 121, most of them other people's
    accounts.

    Each grain narrows through its own key, the same way `enriched` joins it:

      Opportunity   the code is in the caller's scoped rows
      Account       the code (`entity_id`) or the name (`entity_label`) is at
                    an account the caller's scoped rows sit at
      Rep           the rep is one the predicate names; unscoped, every rep
      Industry /    the executive's alone — an entity-wide reading has no
      Segment       owner below that level

    The frame is the same `slice_frame` every figure uses, so a filter that
    narrows the page narrows its findings with it.
