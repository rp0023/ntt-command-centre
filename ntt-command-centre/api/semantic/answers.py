"""
Deterministic answers for every question the product itself suggests.

The Ask panel offers a handful of questions per persona, and every chart offers
two or three of its own. Those strings are a promise: a reader who clicks one
must get a correct, chart-backed answer in plain English, and must get it even
when every language provider is rate-limited — which, on a free tier, is the
normal state during a demo.

So each suggested question is registered here against a function that computes
the answer from the semantic layer. Where the question is a straightforward
breakdown or trend the function builds a query plan and hands it to
`query.execute`, so the chart is chosen by the same shape rule the model-driven
path uses. Where it needs a derived table — deal risk, quiet deals, rep
behaviour, findings, whitespace, plan against actual — it reads the module that
owns that table and draws the chart with `charts.spec`.

Three rules hold for every answer:

  * every number in a sentence goes through `measures.money`, `pct` or `count`;
    a raw float never reaches the page,
  * the sentences follow one shape — what the answer is, how it compares or
    what produced it, and what to do — each in one plain sentence,
  * the row set is the caller's: `slice_frame` applies the persona's predicate
    and the page's filters before anything is counted, so an account executive
    asking a chart question sees their own book and nobody else's.

The lookup key is the normalised question text (lower case, punctuation and
extra whitespace stripped, a few synonyms folded), so a trailing question mark
or "LOB" for "line of business" still matches.
