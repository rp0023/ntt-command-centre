"""
THE CONTEXT LAYER — the machine-readable description of this business that an
LLM is given in place of the data itself.

The client's own architecture, drawn on the 11 Sep call: *"transactional data on
SQL → semantic data where you have your rules, your definitions, your
calculations → an API interface… → your front end."* This module is the part of
the semantic layer that faces the model rather than the screen. It answers, in
one compact document: what entities exist, what every column means in business
terms, what the legal values are, how each measure is defined, which joins are
valid, what the business rules are, and — the part most catalogs omit and most
demos die on — what is NOT true about the data.

Three design decisions, each of which is the reason a naive version fails:

1. **The model never sees rows.** It sees this catalog and a set of pre-computed,
   pre-formatted figures. It answers by emitting a constrained query PLAN, which
   the server validates against this catalog and executes in pandas. There is no
   text-to-SQL, no `eval`, and no path by which user text reaches the dataframe.
   A plan naming a column or a value that is not in here fails validation.

2. **Enumerated values are inlined where the cardinality is small.** Eight stages
   and five portfolios cost a few dozen tokens and remove an entire class of
   failure — the model inventing "Closed Won" when the value is "Deal Won". High
   cardinality columns (357 accounts, 70 reps) carry only their count and a
   handful of examples, and are resolved by lookup at validation time instead.

3. **The caveats are first-class, not a footnote.** `ForecastCategory` perfectly
   predicts the outcome in this extract; the plan does not foot at LOB grain in
   Q3; the anomaly report's `DealValue` is gross profit rather than revenue.
   A model that is not told these things will produce answers that are locally
   correct and globally wrong, and it will produce them confidently.

Budget: the rendered catalog is kept under roughly 6,000 tokens so it fits
comfortably alongside a facts pack in every request without crowding the answer.
