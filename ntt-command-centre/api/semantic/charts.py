"""
Chart specs — the server decides WHAT to draw and WHICH module draws it.

Two things make this more than a formatting layer.

**Shape resolution happens here.** The client re-runs the same rule as a check
and prints `shape → key` in every card footer, so the claim that the repository
is indexed by data shape is verifiable on screen rather than asserted in a
README.

**Every spec declares what it `says`.** A claim key like `gp.open.by:lob` is a
canonical statement of "gross profit, open subset, broken down by line of
business". The view payload unions the claim keys of every chart on screen, and
the AI layer is forbidden from making a `state`-lens sentence whose claim is
already in that set. That is how "the AI must not repeat the charts" becomes a
machine-checked property instead of a line in a prompt that a model may or may
not honour.

Chart choice is a judgement about the QUESTION, not about available variety. A
waterfall is here because "what moved the number" cannot be read off a bar
chart; a mekko because size, mix and margin are three facts that belong in one
picture; a gantt because "has this deal run out of road" is a statement about a
bar and a date. Where a type has no honest use on this data it is not built —
there is no radar chart and no pie.

**The measure toggle is honoured, not echoed.** A chart whose marks are plain
money aggregates — open, won, stalled, at risk, by account, by industry, the
treemap, the flow, the gantt — sums `fs.value_column`, labels itself with
`fs.measure_label` and claims `gp.*` or `rev.*` accordingly. A chart drawn
against the plan (the bridge, month against plan, coverage, the bullets) is
gross profit whichever way the toggle sits, because the plan is set in GP,
and its subtitle says so rather than leaving the reader to wonder why it did
not move.
