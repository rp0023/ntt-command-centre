"""
Cross-sell: the data-science export, fused with what this layer computes itself.

Two engines answer the same question — *what is this account missing that
accounts like it buy?* — and they answer it at different resolutions:

  * **The DS export** (`data/source/cross_sell.csv`, 72 rows over 46 accounts)
    works at **LOB / portfolio** resolution: not "sell them Security" but "sell
    them Security / Technical Services". It carries three independent methods
    (market-basket association, industry bundle, similar-account matching), a
    plain-word confidence, and a written reason per method.
  * **`accounts.whitespace()`** works at **LOB** resolution and estimates what
    the gap is worth using size-matched comparables, which the DS export does
    not do (it quotes a flat peer average).

Fusing them is worth more than either alone, for the same reason the anomaly
layer fuses its two sources: **agreement between methods that cannot see each
other is the strongest signal either can produce.** A recommendation both
engines reach is `corroborated`; one only the DS export reaches is usually an
*upsell inside an LOB the account already buys*, which the LOB-level view is
blind to by construction; one only this layer reaches is a whole missing LOB the
DS export's stricter bar rejected.

The reference guide that came with the export is explicit that these are
**opportunities, not risks**, and that a recommendation is "a starting point,
not a guaranteed sale". Both statements are carried onto the cards rather than
left in a document nobody opens — see `CAVEAT`.
