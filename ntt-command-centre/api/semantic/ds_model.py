"""
The data-science team's deal-closure model, ingested as a first-class input.

`NA_SFDC_Deal_Closure_Model_v2_SHAP_Benchmarks.xlsx` is Tushar's deliverable —
the client's own model, not ours. This platform consumes it rather than
competing with it, which is the division of labour the 15 Sep call set out: the
DS side produces the intelligence, this layer stages the story around it.

What the workbook provides, and what this module exposes:

  Predictions   a calibrated P(win) per opportunity LINE, with a literal and a
                quantile-relative risk bucket. Every one of this book's 3,034
                lines and 2,050 opportunities is present — the DS model was
                trained on a wider 14,872-line extract of which ours is a clean
                subset, so coverage of our open pipeline is 235 of 235.
  SHAP driver   `Main_Driving_Force` — a per-deal, game-theoretic attribution of
                which feature moved THAT prediction most. This is the direct
                answer to the client's "if a deal is at higher risk, what is the
                variable that is driving it".
  Benchmarks    for each of the 9 numeric model features: the benchmark value,
                how it was chosen (median for skewed, mean for symmetric), the
                measured correlation with winning, and a DIRECTION-AWARE colour
                rule. Four of the nine have |r| < 0.02 and the workbook says
                plainly that their colour is near-noise; that caveat is carried
                through to the UI rather than dropped.

**The model is modest and says so.** Test AUC 0.5952, Brier 0.23. The DS team's
own conclusion — "static deal attributes carry almost no signal in this
synthetic dataset, and the model runs almost entirely on movement-derived
progression signals" — matches what this layer measured independently before the
workbook arrived (leakage-free AUC 0.56 on our subset). Both numbers are shown.
Two teams reaching the same weak result by different routes is a finding worth
displaying, not an embarrassment to hide: it says the ceiling is in the data.

That is exactly why `predict.risk_table()` exists alongside this. The DS model
answers *will it close*; the risk score answers *what is wrong with it and what
do I do* — and it runs on signals this model deliberately does not use (stall
age, past-due days, close-date slip, value shrinkage, rep peer z-scores). They
are complements, and the product presents them as such.
