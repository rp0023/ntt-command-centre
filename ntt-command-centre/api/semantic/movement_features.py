"""
Everything the change log knows about an opportunity, reduced to one row each.

This is the module the previous build could not write, because the movement
dataset did not exist yet. It now does, and it is the difference between a
dashboard that reports the present state of the pipeline and a product that can
say *how the pipeline got here* — which deals stopped moving, whose forecasts
walk backwards, which values were inflated at logging and quietly cut before
close, and how long a deal really takes to cross each stage.

Every feature below is computed by replaying the log in `seq` order. Nothing
here reads the fact table's current state, so these features remain an
independent account of the deal and can be compared against it.
