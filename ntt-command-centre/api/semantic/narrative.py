"""
Deterministic narrative — the words the product says when no model is involved.

This module exists for three reasons, in order of importance:

1. **The demo never shows an error.** If every LLM provider is down, rate-limited
   or slow, the page still reads as a finished product. Everything here is
   computed, so it cannot be wrong and cannot be late.
2. **It is the grounding source.** The figures the model is allowed to use are
   the figures this module has already formatted into strings. A model that
   never receives a raw number cannot divide one.
3. **It sets the register.** Professional, specific, and free of the hedging
   that makes generated prose recognisable. The client is presenting this to
   entity leadership at a Japanese-owned global IT services firm; "it appears
   that performance may be trending positively" is worse than silence.

Every sentence carries a `lens` tag — `cause`, `norm`, `delta`, `action`,
`answer` or `state`. The AI layer may only add a `state` sentence whose claim is
NOT already made by a chart on screen. These templates are written in complement
lenses wherever possible for the same reason.
