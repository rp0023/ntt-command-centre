"""
Page assembly — fourteen pages across three personas.

Every page answers exactly ONE stated question and is built from the same parts:
a question, metric summary banners, a narrative, action items, charts, and the evidence
behind them. Sales and Manager share that template; Executive uses a smaller
focused payload built in `executive.py`.

**The personas do not share pages.** An AE's "My Day" and an executive's "TLDR"
are not the same screen with a different filter — they have different questions,
different tiles, different charts and different verbs. A persona that reaches a
page it does not own gets redirected to its own home rather than shown a page
built for someone else's job.

`chartsSay` at the payload root is the union of every chart's claim keys. The AI
layer reads it and is forbidden from restating any of them. That is the
enforcement point for "the AI must not repeat the charts".

    **Within a persona, a chart id appears on exactly one page.** The customer's
    words were that the same chart on two of a persona's pages reads as the
    application not changing when the navigation does. Where one chart was the
    right answer to two questions it stays on the page whose question it
    answers best, and the other page gets a chart that answers ITS question —
    the executive's brief keeps the plan-to-position bridge and the risk bands
    (the landing page must show the closure use case as well as the plan); the
    risks page keeps the anomaly categories and takes the overdue stack, which
    is what "what is it worth" looks like deal by deal; the decisions page
    carries the coverage bullets, because a decision is made a row at a time
    and the heat grid on the performance page is made for finding the hole,
    not for funding it. The manager's pod pulse hands the fingerprint grid to
    the benchmark page, whose question it is, and takes the stalled-by-rep bar
    instead — the pulse asks who needs me, and a band has no phone number.

    **Every page keeps two or three charts.** Across personas the same chart may
    repeat only when the rows and the question both differ: an AE's risk bands
    are their own deals, a manager's the pod's, and the same rows never appear
    twice anywhere.
