/**
 * ActionRail — the ranked worklist of AI-surfaced actions ("Do these next").
 *
 * This is the component the product is for. A chart tells you the shape of the
 * quarter; this tells you what to do in the next two hours, and — crucially —
 * it tells you WHY it is allowed to say it.
 *
 * The shape of the thing: a header strip that lets the reader narrow the feed
 * (All · Critical · High · Risks · Opportunities) and re-order it (the server's
 * rank, value at stake, urgency); a single-column list of concrete next steps
 * with their business context, owner, value and urgency; and ONE expanded
 * panel at a time that opens under the selected item with the why, the
 * rule, the next step and the explanation. Selection is component state, not
 * URL state: which card is open is a reading position, not a view of the data,
 * and it should not survive a reload or pollute a shared link.
 *
 * Three rules are load-bearing here and none of them are decoration:
 *
 * 1. NO RESTATEMENT. The rail never paraphrases a chart. Every sentence the
 *    server returns carries a `lens` — cause / norm / delta / action / answer /
 *    state — which is the licence for that sentence to exist at all. The lens
 *    is therefore rendered, in plain words, next to the sentence: the reader
 *    can see that a line is here because it explains a cause, not because it
 *    read a bar off a chart they are already looking at.
 *
 * 2. REFUSALS ARE SHOWN, NOT SWALLOWED. `dropped` (sentences the server threw
 *    away as redundant with what is on screen) and `rejected` (sentences that
 *    used tokens the data does not support) stay reachable in a provenance
 *    disclosure. Being able to read what the product REFUSED to say is the
 *    reason to believe what it does say.
 *
 * 3. OPPORTUNITY IS NOT A PROBLEM. `framing: "opportunity"` — the cross-sell
 *    and whitespace findings — gets a positive treatment: --good, never red,
 *    never amber, and the value reads "in play", not "at risk". An upside
 *    finding presented in the colour of a fire drill trains people to close
 *    the rail.
 *
 * Nothing here computes a business figure. Filtering and sorting re-arrange
 * the server's cards on fields the server already sent; the segment counts are
 * counts of cards, not of anything in the data. `valueAtStake` is the only raw
 * figure on a card and it goes through lib/format so it reads identically to
 * the same dollar in a KPI tile. Nothing calls Date.now(): the business date
 * is AS_OF and it arrives on the payload.
 *
 * Motion is FLIP: before any change that re-orders the grid the visual rects
 * are snapshotted, and after React commits each surviving card is given the
 * inverse transform and released, so the list slides into its new order rather
 * than jumping. The expanded row animates its height with a grid-template-rows
 * transition (0fr → 1fr). Both run on the --dur tokens, which reduced-motion
 * zeroes, and the snapshot is skipped entirely under that preference.
 *
 * Interaction: the card body toggles the panel (mouse), and its "Details"
 * button does the same thing (keyboard, with aria-expanded). Escape collapses
 * and hands focus back to that button. Every other affordance is a real
 * <button> or a native <details>, so there is no custom role handler to get
 * wrong.
