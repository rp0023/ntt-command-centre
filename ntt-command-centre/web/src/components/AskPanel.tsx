/**
 * Ask AI Expert — the right-hand overlay.
 *
 * It is drawn ABOVE the page, not instead of it: a scrim, a panel, and the
 * lens still visible behind. Nothing navigates, nothing opens a window, and
 * the filter state behind the panel is untouched — closing it returns you to
 * exactly the screen you asked from.
 *
 * The panel is written for someone who does not want to know how it works.
 * An answer is a headline, a few short sentences each introduced by a plain
 * word ("Why", "Compared with", "What to do"), and — when the answer is a
 * breakdown or a trend — the chart that shows it. Everything that proves the
 * answer is honest sits behind one quiet "Details" disclosure at the end:
 *
 *   SCOPE.  The header states, in words, the slice the question is being
 *           answered within. The row-level predicate the server resolved from
 *           the persona is there too, behind a small disclosure, for anyone
 *           who wants to see the rule rather than its name.
 *
 *   PLAN.   Every answer carries the query plan it ran, shown as formatted
 *           JSON. For a typed question the model wrote the plan; for one of
 *           the suggested questions the server chose it itself. Either way
 *           the SERVER executed it and produced every figure, and the plan is
 *           the receipt for that division of labour.
 *
 *   LENS.   Each sentence carries the lens that licenses it to exist —
 *           cause, norm, delta, action, answer, state. The governing rule of
 *           this product is that the AI may not restate what a chart already
 *           shows, so the lens is not decoration: it is the sentence's reason
 *           for being prose rather than a mark. On screen it is a plain word.
 *           Sentences the server threw away (`dropped`, `rejected`) are listed
 *           in Details rather than hidden, because being able to read what the
 *           product refused to say is why the rest of it can be believed.
 *
 * `refused: true` is a first-class, calm state. A question the data cannot
 * support is declined in plain language, with something to ask instead when
 * the server offers it. That is correct behaviour, not an error, and it is
 * styled as a statement rather than as a failure.
 *
 * A thread can arrive already started: a chart's own Ask hands its turns over
 * as `seed`, so expanding into the main chat continues the conversation the
 * reader was having beside the chart rather than restarting it.
