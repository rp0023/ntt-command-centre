/**
 * Ask about THIS chart.
 *
 * Every chart carries its own Ask. The panel opens beside the chart it belongs
 * to — pinned to the right of that card, never centred over the page — because
 * the answer is about the marks you are looking at and you should be able to
 * read both at once. The rest of the page goes quiet behind a blur; the chart
 * itself is lifted above it and stays sharp. That is the whole idea, and it is
 * why this is not simply the main Ask panel opened with a different question.
 *
 * Three things are worth knowing about how it behaves:
 *
 *   THE BOX IS BLANK. No suggested questions, no example in the placeholder:
 *   the customer asked for a plain space to type into, beside the chart, with
 *   the answer in words. The trigger is the spark alone for the same reason.
 *
 *   NOTHING HERE COMPUTES A NUMBER, AND NOTHING HERE DRAWS ONE. The question
 *   goes to the server with the chart's id and the claims already on screen,
 *   the server answers from that chart's own rows, and this panel shows the
 *   sentences only. A chart you are already looking at does not need to be
 *   drawn again beside the words about it; "Open in full chat" is where a
 *   follow-up gets its own chart.
 *
 *   BEING TURNED DOWN IS NOT AN ERROR. When the data cannot answer a question
 *   the server says so, and this panel states it plainly instead of dressing it
 *   up as a failure. A product that guesses is worse than one that declines.
 *
 * The conversation here is deliberately short. "Open in full chat" hands the
 * last question to the main Ask panel, which keeps the longer history.
