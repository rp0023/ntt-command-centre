/**
 * The card a chart lives in: the title, the stated grain, the SVG the D3 module
 * owns, and a footer that names which repository module was selected and why.
 *
 * **The footer is not decoration.** The client asked for a repository of charts
 * chosen by the shape of the data; printing `shape → repositoryKey` on every
 * card is how that claim is checked on screen rather than asserted in a deck.
 * The server resolves the key and stamps it on the spec, the client re-runs the
 * same rule, and a disagreement shows as "(fallback)" instead of being hidden.
 *
 * **The grain is printed too.** Stage counts opportunities, LOB counts lines,
 * and a reader comparing two cards has to be able to see which is which — the
 * same query at two grains gives two different right answers.
 *
 * **Ask is opt-in, by passing `ask`.** A card on the page gets one; the card
 * that renders an ANSWER's chart inside the Ask panel does not, because a chart
 * you can ask about inside the answer to a question about a chart is a hall of
 * mirrors, not a feature.
 *
 * **The footnote is a caveat about the marks above it**, not small print: "the
 * red tail is time already overrun", "these months have no closed history yet".
 * Dropping it is how a green pill ends up on a quarter nobody should trust.
