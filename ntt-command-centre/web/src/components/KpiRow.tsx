/**
 * Legacy KPI tile row retained for API compatibility. Pages render the same
 * metrics through MetricBannerGroup.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS COMPONENT EXISTS TO ENFORCE: colour encodes goodness, not sign.
 * `tone` is the colour; `direction` says which way is good. Past-due pipeline
 * rising is DANGER even though the number went up, and pipeline coverage
 * rising is GOOD — so nothing here ever derives a colour from an arrow, a sign
 * or a delta. The tile paints `tone`; the direction glyph is muted chrome that
 * states, in words a screen reader reads out, whether higher is better or
 * worse. Two channels, two meanings, neither inferred from the other.
 *
 * The tile also holds no number of its own. `Kpi.formatted` is rendered
 * verbatim — the server formats, the client displays. There is no arithmetic
 * in this file and no call to a formatter, because a figure that is computed
 * twice is a figure that can disagree with itself.
 *
 * EVERY TILE IS A PLACE TO ASK. The customer's word was "referenceable": a
 * number on a tile should be something you can point at and interrogate, not
 * a label you read past. So every tile is a real button that opens a small
 * popover under itself — the label, the figure, the server's own sub line,
 * what its direction means in words, and one action that takes the question
 * to the Ask panel. The popover is the only place the tile explains itself;
 * the tile face stays as quiet as before, because six tiles that each carry
 * their own paragraph are a wall. One popover is open at a time, Escape and
 * an outside click close it, and it flips to stay on screen at the right edge.
 *
 * The raised icon square is the tile's handle: a tone-tinted solid, drawn in
 * the same isometric style as the persona marks, that lifts and tilts when the
 * tile is hovered so the whole card reads as something you can pick up.
