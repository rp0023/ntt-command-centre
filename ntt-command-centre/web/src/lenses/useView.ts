/**
 * Fetch hooks.
 *
 * Two behaviours worth naming:
 *
 * **The page renders before the AI does.** `useView` returns the computed
 * payload — every KPI, chart and action card — and `useBrief` fetches the
 * generated narrative separately. The page is therefore complete and correct in
 * one round trip, and the prose upgrades in place when it arrives. A product
 * that waits on a language model to paint its first pixel is a product that
 * looks broken whenever the model is slow, which on a free tier is often.
 *
 * **Every fetch is abortable and keyed.** Switching persona while a request is
 * in flight must not let the old persona's payload land in the new persona's
 * page; the abort plus the key check makes that impossible rather than unlikely.
 *
 * **A key change drops the previous payload, it does not keep it under a
 * spinner.** `useView` used to hold the old page's data while the new one
 * loaded, so clicking a sidebar item moved the highlight and left the previous
 * page's question, tiles and charts painted until the response came back —
 * on a cold Cloud Run instance that is seconds, and it is exactly what the
 * customer reported as "the right side does not change". Worse, `useBrief`
 * saw the stale `chartsSay` with the NEW page key and asked the model for a
 * brief with the wrong forbidden list; the correct request followed a moment
 * later, so every navigation cost two generations on a per-minute allowance
 * and the wrong one was what got cached. Nulling the data on a key change is
 * what makes the skeleton show, and it is what stops the brief firing before
 * the page it must not repeat has arrived.

 *
 * The shell and the page both need the view payload — the shell for the scope
 * label and for the claim keys it hands the Ask panel, the page for everything
 * it draws. Without this they would issue the same request twice on every
 * navigation. Keyed on the request itself, so two callers asking the same
 * question share one answer and a third asking a different one is unaffected.
 *
 * Entries are dropped as soon as the promise settles: this is a request
 * coalescer, not a data cache, and holding results here would mean a stale
 * payload after the user changes something the key does not capture.
